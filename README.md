What is Fallen Angel?
---------------------

Fallen Angel is an open source mod for Homeworld 2, based on a story of the Great War and the Exile. What makes it different from other mods is that we are focused on the story. It won't be yet another mod with hundreds of new ships, effects and gameplay options. We will create only (or in the first instance) new campaign with only story-required units. Why? Because reuse of Relic models helps saving a lot of time, and we don't have unlimited time.

How to contribute?
------------------

You don't have to be a programmer, however some modding experience will be welcomed. What we need is the story, as I said before. Writing a good story is probably the most difficult thing in game development, so we need your help.
You have a nice idea? Tell us, please. We will consider joining it in our mod.

You can (and we encourage you to do so!) fork this project, work on your own, and when you think it will be nice to send us your changes you can just send us a pull request.
You can also join the core team and push changes directly to the FA project.

There are only a few prerequisites:
* Read the entire History of Hiigara book. It's only 31 pages long, but its content is very important.
* You should have GitHub account. It will make synchronizing our work much easier.
